# Project Template

This is a template repository for research projects in our group. It outlines what projects should contain to make them known people, easy to adopt, and verifiable. This template summarizes what should be included in your project's repository.

## Paper

You should include a link to your paper in arXiv. If you have given a talk, then you should also include a link to your presentation slides.

## Demo

If possible, you should have an online demo version of your work. In addition, you should have a link to a short video that showcases what you've done.

You can host the demo on our group servers or through another platform of your choice. If your demo has no server-side code, then you can use a static site host like [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

TODO: add instructions for how to host a tool on our own servers.

## Installable Software and Documentation

You should include intstructions for how a user can run your software on their own.

TODO: add details for how docker can be used to make it easy for someone to deploy your tool.

## Experimental Data

If experimental data is available, then your repo should include:
* Link to the registered design in [OSF](https://osf.io/)
* Details of the methodology and material used
* Collected data
* Scripts/code used to analyze the data


## License
